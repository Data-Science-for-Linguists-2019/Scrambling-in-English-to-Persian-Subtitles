# Progress Reports

#### 0: The General Plan
This repository and all the files within have been gathered and created 
for my final project for the Spring 2019 semester of LING 1340/2340. 
Files will continue to be added as time goes on, and there will be three 
major progress reports. 

By the first official progress report, I hope to have a Persian parser 
(or some combination of Persian parsers) that allows me to reliably 
search the TEP. Fingers crossed!
