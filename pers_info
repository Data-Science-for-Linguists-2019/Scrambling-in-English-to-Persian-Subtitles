BASIC INFORMATION ON THE PERSIAN LANGUAGE

In case you are unfamiliar with Persian, the following summarization should cover everything you need to know about the language.

Alphabet:
Persian uses a modified version of the Arabic alphabet, including four extra characters that maintain the sound patterns that existed prior to the adoption of the Arabic alphabet.

Morphology:
Persian marks verbs for both person and number. Persian is considered a pro-drop language, meaning that subject pronouns are sometimes excluded, since the verb marks both the necessary qualities of the subject.

Syntax:
Generally speaking, Persian is underlyingly SOV; however, numerous examples of scrambling have been cited, most famously in Karimi (2005). Certain structures indicate an SVO word order.
